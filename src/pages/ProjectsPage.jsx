                <p>
                    This is a virtual plant that I made using JS, HTML and CSS.
                    It's essentially a Tamagotchi but with only one need: water.
                    The plant will grow while it has water or die if it doesn't
                    get water for a long time.
                </p>

                    Here's an entire website I made for a plant nursery;
                    complete with a contact page, a gallery, a blog, and the

                <p>
                    Based on Kurzgesagt's Calendar of Life. Every week in your
                    life is a dot, so it looks like a progress bar.

                <h2 id="ecoSim">Eco system simulation</h2>
                <p>
                    Rocks eat scissors, scissors eat paper, and paper eats rock.
                    Each population size fluctuates like in nature, based on the
                    number of predators and prey. Really mesmerizing to watch.
                    You could root for a winner and see the result. It's as
                    deterministic as using a randint function, but a lot slower.
                    <br />
                    This project is made using pygame zero. Every entity on
                    screen is of the class "hand" and is classified into rock,
                    paper, or scissors depending on what list they're in.

                <p>
                    A super simple flashcards app that I made to help me study.
                    All the cards are stored locally on the clinents computer
                    using localstorage.

                    This one is a bit more extensive in some ways. The project
                    itself is more modular, but it does not show the
                    explainations for each card.

                <p>
                    A simulation of the boids algorithm. The boids are birds
                    that follow three simple rules: separation, alignment and
                    cohesion. The result is a mesmerizing simulation of a flock
                    of birds.
